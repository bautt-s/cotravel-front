# CoTravel - Landing Page
A simple front-end landing page project.

This was a completely front-end project made for a freelance client, out of a dribbble concept design. It involves TypeScript, React, and a mix of Tailwind with traditional CSS. It can be viewed in a comfortable view in every device, with light and dark color modes, and fancy animations. 

## Installation

Running this front-end in a local machine is quite easy: just clone the repository into your local files, and then open the console in the same directory: command ``npm install`` to install all dependencies, and ``npm start`` to run the project on localhost.

The main dependencies are React 18.2, Tailwind 3.3.2, TypeScript 4.9.5, and some aditional dependencies (Swiper 9.4.1 for the carousel, and React Icons 4.10.1 for all the SVGs displayed).
